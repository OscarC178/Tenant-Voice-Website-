This guide is for tenants and landlords in the private rented sector to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. It provides a checklist and more detailed information on each stage of the process, including:


  what to look out for before renting
  living in a rented home
  what happens at the end of a tenancy
  what to do if things go wrong


This is the most up to date version of the Guide. It incorporates all changes detailed in the update history below.

We are updating the easy read which supports tenants with learning disabilities. It is supplementary to How to Rent: the checklist for renting in England and will be available as an additional supporting resource where appropriate.
