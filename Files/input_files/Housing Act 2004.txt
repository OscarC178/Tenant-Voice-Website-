are satisfied in relation to the area.
(3) The first set of general conditions are— (a) that the area is, or is likely to become, an area of low housing demand; and (b) that making a designation will, when combined with other measures taken
in the area by the local housing authority, or by other persons together with the local housing authority, contribute to the improvement of the social or economic conditions in the area.
(4) In deciding whether an area is, or is likely to become, an area of low housing demand a local housing authority must take into account (among other matters)—
(a) the value of residential premises in the area, in comparison to the value of similar premises in other areas which the authority consider to be comparable (whether in terms of types of housing, local amenities, availability of transport or otherwise);
(b) the turnover of occupiers of residential premises; (c) the number of residential premises which are available to buy or rent and the
length of time for which they remain unoccupied.
(5) The appropriate national authority may by order amend subsection (4) by adding new matters to those for the time being mentioned in that subsection.
(6) The second set of general conditions are— (a) that the area is experiencing a significant and persistent problem caused by
anti-social behaviour; (b) that some or all of the private sector landlords who have let premises in the
area (whether under leases or licences) are failing to take action to combat the problem that it would be appropriate for them to take; and
(c) that making a designation will, when combined with other measures taken in the area by the local housing authority, or by other persons together with the local housing authority, lead to a reduction in, or the elimination of, the problem.
“Private sector landlord” does not include [F43a non-profit registered provider of social housing or] a registered social landlord within the meaning of Part 1 of the Housing Act 1996 (c. 52).
(7) The appropriate national authority may by order provide for any conditions specified in the order to apply as an additional set of conditions for the purposes of subsection (2).
(8) The conditions that may be specified include, in particular, conditions intended to permit a local housing authority to make a designation for the purpose of dealing with one or more specified problems affecting persons occupying Part 3 houses in the area.
“Specified” means specified in an order under subsection (7).
(9) Before making a designation the local housing authority must— (a) take reasonable steps to consult persons who are likely to be affected by the
designation; and (b) consider any representations made in accordance with the consultation and
not withdrawn.

Introductory
132 Empty dwelling management orders: introductory
(1) This Chapter deals with the making by a local housing authority of— (a) an interim empty dwelling management order (an “interim EDMO”), or (b) a final empty dwelling management order (a “final EDMO”),

(2) An interim EDMO is an order made to enable a local housing authority, with the consent of the relevant proprietor, to take steps for the purpose of securing that a dwelling becomes and continues to be occupied.
(3) A final EDMO is an order made, in succession to an interim EDMO or a previous final EDMO, for the purpose of securing that a dwelling is occupied.
(4) In this Chapter— (a) “dwelling” means—
(i) a building intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling, or (ii) a part of a building intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling
which may be entered otherwise than through any non-residential accommodation in the building;
(b) any reference to “the dwelling”, in relation to an interim EDMO or a final EDMO, is a reference to the dwelling to which the order relates;
(c) “relevant proprietor”, in relation to a dwelling, means— (i) if the dwelling is let under one or more leases with an unexpired term
of 7 years or more, the lessee under whichever of those leases has the shortest unexpired term; or
(ii) in any other case, the person who has the freehold estate in the dwelling;
(d) “third party”, in relation to a dwelling, means any person who has an estate or interest in the dwelling (other than the relevant proprietor and any person who is a tenant under a lease granted under paragraph 2(3)(c) or 10(3)(c) of Schedule 7); and
(e) any reference (however expressed) to rent or other payments in respect of occupation of a dwelling, includes any payments that the authority receive from persons in respect of unlawful occupation of the dwelling.
(5) In subsection (4)(c), the reference to an unexpired term of 7 years or more of a lease of a dwelling is—
(a) in relation to a dwelling in respect of which the local housing authority are considering making an interim EDMO, a reference to the unexpired term of the lease at the time the authority begin taking steps under section 133(3),

(b) to ascertain what steps (if any) he is taking, or is intending to take, to secure that the dwelling is occupied.

OVERCROWDING NOTICES
139 Service of overcrowding notices
(1) This Chapter applies to any HMO— (a) in relation to which no interim or final management order is in force; and (b) which is not required to be licensed under Part 2.
(2) The local housing authority may serve an overcrowding notice on one or more relevant persons if, having regard to the rooms available, it considers that an excessive number of persons is being, or is likely to be, accommodated in the HMO concerned.
(3) The authority must, at least 7 days before serving an overcrowding notice— (a) inform in writing every relevant person (whether or not the person on whom
the authority is to serve the notice) of their intention to serve the notice; and (b) ensure that, so far as is reasonably possible, every occupier of the HMO
concerned is informed of the authority’s intention.
(4) The authority must also give the persons informed under subsection (3) an opportunity of making representations about the proposal to serve an overcrowding notice.
(5) An overcrowding notice becomes operative, if no appeal is brought under section 143, at the end of the period of 21 days from the date of service of the notice.
(6) If no appeal is brought under section 143, an overcrowding notice is final and conclusive as to matters which could have been raised on such an appeal.
(7) A person who contravenes an overcrowding notice commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale.
(8) In proceedings for an offence under subsection (7) it is a defence that the person had a reasonable excuse for contravening the notice.

(2) That value shall be taken to be the price which, at that time, the interest to be reconveyed, conveyed, surrendered or assigned would realise if sold on the open market by a willing vendor, on the assumption that any liability under the covenant required by paragraph 1 (repayment of discount on early disposal) would be discharged by the vendor.
(3) If the offer is accepted in accordance with regulations under paragraph 2A, no payment shall be required in pursuance of any such covenant as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), but the consideration shall be reduced, subject to sub-paragraph (4), by such amount (if any) as, on a disposal made at the time the offer was made, being a relevant disposal which is not an exempted disposal, would fall to be paid under that covenant.

SCHEDULE 9 Section 183
NEW SCHEDULE 5A TO THE HOUSING ACT 1985: INITIAL DEMOLITION NOTICES
“SCHEDULE 5A Section 138A
INITIAL DEMOLITION NOTICES
Initial demolition notices 1 (1) For the purposes of this Schedule an “initial demolition notice”is a notice served on a
secure tenant— (a) stating that the landlord intends to demolish the dwelling-house or (as the case
may be) the building containing it (“the relevant premises”), (b) setting out the reasons why the landlord intends to demolish the relevant
premises, (c) specifying the period within which he intends to demolish those premises, and (d) stating that, while the notice remains in force, he will not be under any
obligation to make such a grant as is mentioned in section 138(1) in respect of any claim made by the tenant to exercise the right to buy in respect of the dwelling-house.
(2) An initial demolition notice must also state— (a) that the notice does not prevent—
(i) the making by the tenant of any such claim, or (ii) the taking of steps under this Part in connection with any such claim up
to the point where section 138(1) would otherwise operate in relation to the claim, or
(iii) the operation of that provision in most circumstances where the notice ceases to be in force, but
(b) that, if the landlord subsequently serves a final demolition notice in respect of the dwelling-house, the right to buy will not arise in respect of it while that notice is in force and any existing claim will cease to be effective.
(3) If, at the time when an initial demolition notice is served, there is an existing claim to exercise the right to buy in respect of the dwelling-house, the notice shall—
(a) state that section 138C confers a right to compensation in respect of certain expenditure, and
(b) give details of that right to compensation and of how it may be exercised.
(4) The period specified in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(c) must not— (a) allow the landlord more than what is, in the circumstances, a reasonable period
to carry out the proposed demolition of the relevant premises (whether on their own or as part of a scheme involving the demolition of other premises); or
(b) in any case expire more than five years after the date of service of the notice on the tenant.
Period of validity of initial demolition notice 2 (1) For the purposes of this Schedule an initial demolition notice—

will cease to be in force, unless revoked or otherwise terminated under or by virtue of paragraph 3 below,
(e) that, during the period of validity of any such notice or notices, the landlord will not be under any obligation to make such a grant as is mentioned in section 138(1) in respect of any claim to exercise the right to buy in respect of any dwelling-house contained in those premises,
(f) that there may be a right to compensation under section 138C in respect of certain expenditure incurred in respect of any existing claim.
Revocation or termination of initial demolition notices 3 (1) Paragraph 15(4) to (7) of Schedule 5 (revocation notices) shall apply in relation to an
initial demolition notice as they apply in relation to a final demolition notice.
(2) If a compulsory purchase order has been made for the purpose of enabling the landlord to demolish the dwelling-house in respect of which he has served an initial demolition notice (whether or not it would enable him to demolish any other premises as well) and—
(a) a relevant decision within sub-paragraph (3)(a) becomes effective while the notice is in force, or
(b) a relevant decision within sub-paragraph (3)(b) becomes final while the notice is in force,
the notice ceases to be in force as from the date when the decision becomes effective or final.
(3) A “relevant decision”is— (a) a decision under Part 2 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 to confirm the
order with modifications, or not to confirm the whole or part of the order, or (b) a decision of the High Court to quash the whole or part of the order under

(9) In such a case the final demolition notice must state that it is replacing the initial demolition notice.

(for any reason) ceased to be in force in respect of a dwelling-house without it being demolished.
