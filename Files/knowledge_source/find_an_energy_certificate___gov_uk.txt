Find an energy certificate

Find an energy certificate for a property in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. This includes homes, business properties and public buildings.

This service is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Thereâ€™s a different service to find an energy certificate for properties in Scotland.

You can use this service to find an existing:

*   energy performance certificate (EPC)
*   display energy certificate (DEC) for a public building
*   air conditioning inspection certificate and report

If your property does not have an energy certificate or it has expired, you can get a new energy certificate.

You can search for a certificate by postcode, street name and town, or certificate number.
