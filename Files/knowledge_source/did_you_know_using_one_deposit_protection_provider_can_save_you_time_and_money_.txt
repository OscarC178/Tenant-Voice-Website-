Choose Custodial or Insured Deposit Protection

The DPS is authorised by the Government to provide two types of deposit protection, custodial and insured. When you move all your deposits to The DPS you can choose the scheme that’s right for you. Here’s an overview to help you decide.

**Custodial**

What does it cost? Nothing, it's totally free.

How does it work? It’s all online. You add the tenancy and give us the deposit. We keep the deposit safe, inform the tenant it’s protected, automatically create the Prescribed Information documents for you to send to your tenant, helping you stay on top of your legal obligations, and take care of the deposit repayment and administration on your behalf when instructed.

I have lots of deposits to protect and the administration is time consuming. We can help you with that. You can protect deposits for multiple tenancies with our bulk upload tool. You can also request deposit repayment for multiple deposits, significantly reducing your administration. Large agencies may also benefit from additional dedicated managed support to resolve issues and address other queries.

Some schemes charge yearly membership or renewal fees, do you? No. It’s totally free, no need to worry about additional annual costs.

**Insured**

What does it cost? A small fee per deposit protected.

How does it work? You hold the deposit, arrange for safe storage, provide the tenant with the Prescribed Information documents, and handle all deposit repayment administration at the end of the tenancy. We inform the tenant it’s protected.

I have lots of deposits to protect and the administration is time consuming. If you’re protecting over 100 deposits at one time, contact business@depositprotection.com to discuss a volume discount.

Some schemes charge yearly membership or renewal fees, do you? No. You only pay the initial protection fee which covers the deposit for the lifetime of the tenancy, and there are no fee increases based on the number of disputes.

Making the move to a single provider is surprisingly easy with The DPS. Join us today.
