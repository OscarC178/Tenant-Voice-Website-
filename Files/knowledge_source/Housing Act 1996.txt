(4) After paragraph 4 there shall be inserted—
“4A (1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the value of the interest of the
tenant under the existing lease is the amount which at the valuation date that interest might be expected to realise if sold on the open market by a willing seller (with neither the landlord nor any owner of an intermediate leasehold interest buying or seeking to buy) on the following assumptions—
(a) on the assumption that the vendor is selling such interest as is held by the tenant subject to any interest inferior to the interest of the tenant;
(b) on the assumption that Chapter I and this Chapter confer no right to acquire any interest in any premises containing the tenant’s flat or to acquire any new lease;
(c) on the assumption that any increase in the value of the flat which is attributable to an improvement carried out at his own expense by the tenant or by any predecessor in title is to be disregarded; and
(d) on the assumption that (subject to paragraph (b)) the vendor is selling with and subject to the rights and burdens with and subject to which any interest inferior to the existing lease of the tenant has effect.
(2) It is hereby declared that the fact that sub-paragraph (1) requires assumptions to be made in relation to particular matters does not preclude the making of assumptions as to other matters where those assumptions are appropriate for determining the amount which at the valuation date the interest of the tenant under his existing lease might be expected to realise if sold as mentioned in that sub-paragraph.
(3) In determining any such amount there shall be made such deduction (if any) in respect of any defect in title as on a sale of that interest on the open market might be expected to be allowed between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the value of the interest of the tenant under his existing lease shall not be increased by reason of—
(a) any transaction which— (i) is entered into after 19th January 1996, and
(ii) involves the creation or transfer of an interest inferior to the tenant’s existing lease; or
(b) any alteration after that date of the terms on which any such inferior interest is held.
(5) Sub-paragraph (4) shall not apply to any transaction which falls within paragraph (a) of that sub-paragraph if—
(a) the transaction is entered into in pursuance of a contract entered into on or before the date mentioned in that paragraph; and
(b) the amount of the premium payable by the tenant in respect of the grant of the new lease was determined on or before that date either by agreement or by a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Chapter.

date that interest (assuming it to have been granted to him at that date) might be expected to realise if sold on the open market by a willing seller (with the owner of any interest superior to the interest of the tenant not buying or seeking to buy) on the following assumptions—
(a) on the assumption that the vendor is selling such interest as is to be held by the tenant under the new lease subject to the inferior interests to which the tenant’s existing lease is subject at the valuation date;
(b) on the assumption that Chapter I and this Chapter confer no right to acquire any interest in any premises containing the tenant’s flat or to acquire any new lease;
(c) on the assumption that there is to be disregarded any increase in the value of the flat which would fall to be disregarded under paragraph (c) of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 4A in valuing in accordance with that sub-paragraph the interest of the tenant under his existing lease; and
(d) on the assumption that (subject to paragraph (b)) the vendor is selling with and subject to the rights and burdens with and subject to which any interest inferior to the tenant’s existing lease at the valuation date then has effect.
(2) It is hereby declared that the fact that sub-paragraph (1) requires assumptions to be made in relation to particular matters does not preclude the making of assumptions as to other matters where those assumptions are appropriate for determining the amount which at the valuation date the interest to be held by the tenant under the new lease might be expected to realise if sold as mentioned in that sub-paragraph.
(3) In determining any such amount there shall be made such deduction (if any) in respect of any defect in title as on a sale of that interest on the open market might be expected to be allowed between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the value of the interest to be held by the tenant under the new lease shall not be decreased by reason of—
(a) any transaction which— (i) is entered into after 19th January 1996, and
(ii) involves the creation or transfer of an interest inferior to the tenant’s existing lease; or
(b) any alteration after that date of the terms on which any such inferior interest is held.
(5) Sub-paragraph (4) shall not apply to any transaction which falls within paragraph (a) of that sub-paragraph if—
(a) the transaction is entered into in pursuance of a contract entered into on or before the date mentioned in that paragraph; and
(b) the amount of the premium payable by the tenant in respect of the grant of the new lease was determined on or before that date either by agreement or by a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Chapter.”.
(5) This section applies in relation to any claim made after 19th January 1996 by the giving of notice under section 42 of the Act of 1993 unless the amount of the premium payable in pursuance of the claim has been determined, either by agreement or by a leasehold valuation tribunal under Chapter II of the Act of 1993, before the day on which this Act is passed.

(1) A tenancy remains an introductory tenancy until the end of the trial period, unless one of the events mentioned in subsection (5) occurs before the end of that period.
(2) The “trial period” is the period of one year beginning with— (a) in the case of a tenancy which was entered into by a local housing authority
or housing action trust— (i) the date on which the tenancy was entered into, or
(ii) if later, the date on which a tenant was first entitled to possession under the tenancy; or
(b) in the case of a tenancy which was adopted by a local housing authority or housing action trust, the date of adoption;
[F313 but this is subject to subsections (3) and (4) and to section 125A (extension of trial period by 6 months). ] .
(3) Where the tenant under an introductory tenancy was formerly a tenant under another introductory tenancy, [F314or a relevant assured shorthold tenancy] , any period or periods during which he was such a tenant shall count towards the trial period, provided—
(a) if there was one such period, it ended immediately before the date specified in subsection (2), and
(b) if there was more than one such period, the most recent period ended immediately before that date and each period succeeded the other without interruption.
[F315(3A) In subsection (3) “relevant assured shorthold tenancy” means— (a) an assured shorthold tenancy in respect of social housing under which the
landlord is a private registered provider of social housing, or (b) an assured shorthold tenancy under which the landlord is a registered social
landlord; and for these purposes “social housing” has the same meaning as in Part 2 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008.]
(4) Where there are joint tenants under an introductory tenancy, the reference in subsection (3) to the tenant shall be construed as referring to the joint tenant in whose case the application of that subsection produces the earliest starting date for the trial period.
(5) A tenancy ceases to be an introductory tenancy if, before the end of the trial period— (a) the circumstances are such that the tenancy would not otherwise be a secure
tenancy, (b) a person or body other than a local housing authority or housing action trust
becomes the landlord under the tenancy, (c) the election in force when the tenancy was entered into or adopted is revoked,

[F403166AAllocation in accordance with allocation scheme: England
(1) Every local housing authority in England must have a scheme (their “allocation scheme”) for determining priorities, and as to the procedure to be followed, in allocating housing accommodation.
For this purpose “procedure” includes all aspects of the allocation process, including the persons or descriptions of persons by whom decisions are taken.
(2) The scheme must include a statement of the authority's policy on offering people who are to be allocated housing accommodation—
(a) a choice of housing accommodation; or (b) the opportunity to express preferences about the housing accommodation to
be allocated to them.
(3) As regards priorities, the scheme shall, subject to subsection (4), be framed so as to secure that reasonable preference is given to—
(a) people who are homeless (within the meaning of Part 7); (b) people who are owed a duty by any local housing authority under
section 190(2), 193(2) or 195(2) (or under section 65(2) or 68(2) of the Housing Act 1985) or who are occupying accommodation secured by any such authority under section 192(3);
(c) people occupying insanitary or overcrowded housing or otherwise living in unsatisfactory housing conditions;
(d) people who need to move on medical or welfare grounds (including any grounds relating to a disability); and
(e) people who need to move to a particular locality in the district of the authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship (to themselves or to others).
The scheme may also be framed so as to give additional preference to particular descriptions of [F404people within one or more of paragraphs (a) to (e)] (being descriptions of people with urgent housing needs). [F405 The scheme must be framed so as to give additional preference to a person with urgent housing needs who falls within one or more of paragraphs (a) to (e) and who –
(i) is serving in the regular forces and is suffering from a serious injury, illness or disability which is attributable (wholly or partly) to the person’s service,
(ii) formerly served in the regular forces, (iii) has recently ceased, or will cease to be entitled, to reside in accommodation
provided by the Ministry of Defence following the death of that person’s spouse or civil partner who has served in the regular forces and whose death was attributable (wholly or partly) to that service, or
(iv) is serving or has served in the reserve forces and is suffering from a serious injury, illness or disability which is attributable (wholly or partly) to the person’s service.
For this purpose “the regular forces” and “the reserve forces” have the meanings given by section 374 of the Armed Forces Act 2006.]
(4) People are to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (3) if they would not have fallen within paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection without the local housing authority having had regard to a restricted person (within the meaning of Part 7).

(4) In a case where— (a) a notice under this section has been served on the landlord, and (b) his interest in the premises specified in pursuance of subsection (2)(b) is

by order (whether interlocutory or final) appoint a manager to carry out in relation to any premises to which this Part applies—
(a) such functions in connection with the management of the premises, or (b) such functions of a receiver,
or both, as the tribunal thinks fit.
(2) A leasehold valuation tribunal may only make an order under this section in the following circumstances, namely—
(a) where the tribunal is satisfied— (i) that the landlord either is in breach of any obligation owed by him
to the tenant under his tenancy and relating to the management of the premises in question or any part of them or (in the case of an obligation dependent on notice) would be in breach of any such obligation but for the fact that it has not been reasonably practicable for the tenant to give him the appropriate notice, and
(ii) that it is just and convenient to make the order in all the circumstances of the case;
(ab) where the tribunal is satisfied— (i) that unreasonable service charges have been made, or are proposed
or likely to be made, and (iii) that it is just and convenient to make the order in all the circumstances
of the case; (ac) where the tribunal is satisfied—
(i) that the landlord has failed to comply with any relevant provision of a code of practice approved by the Secretary of State under section 87 of the M114Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (codes of management practice), and
(ii) that it is just and convenient to make the order in all the circumstances of the case; or
(b) where the tribunal is satisfied that other circumstances exist which make it just and convenient for the order to be made.
(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2)(ab) a service charge shall be taken to be unreasonable—
(a) if the amount is unreasonable having regard to the items for which it is payable,
(b) if the items for which it is payable are of an unnecessarily high standard, or (c) if the items for which it is payable are of an insufficient standard with the

(3) The premises in respect of which an order is made under this section may, if the tribunal thinks fit, be either more or less extensive than the premises specified in the application on which the order is made.
(4) An order under this section may make provision with respect to— (a) such matters relating to the exercise by the manager of his functions under
the order, and (b) such incidental or ancillary matters,
as the tribunal thinks fit; and, on any subsequent application made for the purpose by the manager, the tribunal may give him directions with respect to any such matters.

(7) In a case where an application for an order under this section was preceded by the service of a notice under section 22, the tribunal may, if it thinks fit, make such an order notwithstanding—
(a) that any period specified in the notice in pursuance of subsection (2)(d) of that section was not a reasonable period, or
(b) that the notice failed in any other respect to comply with any requirement contained in subsection (2) of that section or in any regulations applying to the notice under section 54(3).
(8) The M116Land Charges Act 1972 and the M117Land Registration Act 1925 shall apply in relation to an order made under this section as they apply in relation to an order appointing a receiver or sequestrator of land.
