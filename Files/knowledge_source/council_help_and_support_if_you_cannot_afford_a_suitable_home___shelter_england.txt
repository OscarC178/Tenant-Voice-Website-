The council must look into your needs and situation if you ask them for homeless help. They must write a personal housing plan for you if they decide that you're homeless or threatened with homelessness and you meet immigration conditions. This includes what you can afford, the size and location of housing you need and any disability or health needs.

If you cannot afford to stay in your home, you can be legally homeless if you cannot afford to pay your rent or mortgage as well as for other important things like food, heating, clothes and transport. You can ask the council to count you as homeless and help you to find housing that you can afford. You do not always need an eviction notice from your landlord to get this help.

The council might ask to see details of your rent or mortgage costs, household bills, income from work, benefits or a pension, child maintenance payments, and contributions to your rent or mortgage from other people - for example, adult children who live with you.

Tell the council if you need to stay in the area because of work, you care for someone in the area, a local support network, specialist medical appointments, or children in school or college - especially if they have support needs for their education or are studying for exams.

The council must try to find you housing in their area. You might be offered housing in a different area if there is not enough housing you can afford where you live.
