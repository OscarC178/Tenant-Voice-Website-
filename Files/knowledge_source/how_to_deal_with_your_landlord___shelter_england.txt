Many landlords assume their tenants will leave at the end of a section 21 notice. Let your landlord or agent know if you will stay past the end of the notice to avoid any confusion. Tell your landlord if you are getting help from the council and that you cannot move out until you have somewhere to go. Remind them that the notice does not end your tenancy.

Continue to pay rent and only agree a move out date if you find somewhere to live. Talk to your landlord if you have problems paying your rent and keep records of what you say.

Pressure to leave from a landlord or agent without taking the right legal steps is harassment. Changing the locks or making you move out is an illegal eviction. Harassment and illegal eviction are criminal offences.

Do not sign documents that could end your right to stay in your home if you are not ready to move out. Be careful when asked to sign anything that looks official or legal. Do not sign anything labelled 'deed of surrender' or 'express surrender' unless you are ready to give up your tenancy and leave without a court order. A deed of surrender will only meet legal requirements if you and your landlord sign it, both signatures are witnessed, and it makes it clear that it is a deed that ends your tenancy straight away.

Some landlords offer money to leave or say they will write off rent arrears if you agree to go. This may feel tempting but it is only likely to be a good option if you have somewhere settled to move to. Only accept money to move out if it will help you get somewhere else to live. Make sure you have the money or a written agreement to write off arrears before you hand your keys back.
