Contact your landlord about rent

Speak to your landlord as soon as you can. Tell them:
- why you are behind with the rent
- what you are doing to sort things out

Some people worry about talking to their landlord about money problems. But it can help to sort things out if they know you are dealing with your rent arrears.

Shelter adviser Hannah talks about how important it is to tell your landlord how you plan to manage rent arrears.

Keep written records

Use email, messages or a letter so you have a record of:
- when you contacted the landlord or agent
- what you said to them

Keep emails, messages and letters together in a file or in a folder on your computer or phone.

Use our letter template

Copy our letter template into an email or message to your landlord. You can also send the letter as an email attachment or by post.

How to deal with pressure to leave

You cannot be forced to leave your home straight away if you are behind with the rent. Your landlord must follow the legal eviction process if they want you to leave.

It could be harassment if your landlord says you have to leave because of rent arrears.

Find letter templates to explain your rights if you have rent arrears.

Get advice as soon as you miss a payment

Find out where to get:
- benefits advice
- debt and money advice

Benefits advisers can check your benefits, help you apply and sort out mistakes by the DWP or the council.

Debt and money advisers can help you budget and sort out debts.
