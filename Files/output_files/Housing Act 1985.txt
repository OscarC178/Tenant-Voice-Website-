36 Liability to repay is a charge on the premises.
(1) The liability that may arise under the covenant required by section 35 is a charge on the house, taking effect as if it had been created by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage.
[F132(2) Subject to subsections (2A) and (2B), the charge has priority immediately after any legal charge securing an amount—
(a) left outstanding by the purchaser, or (b) advanced to him by an approved lending institution for the purpose of enabling
him to acquire the interest disposed of on the first disposal.
(2A) The following, namely— (a) any advance which is made otherwise than for the purpose mentioned in
subsection (2)(b) and is secured by a legal charge having priority to the charge taking effect by virtue of this section, and
(b) any further advance which is so secured, shall rank in priority to that charge if, and only if, the local authority by written notice served on the institution concerned gives their consent; and the local authority shall so give their consent if the purpose of the advance or further advance is an approved purpose.
(2B) The local authority may at any time by written notice served on an approved lending institution postpone the charge taking effect by virtue of this section to any advance or further advance which—
(a) is made to the purchaser by that institution, and (b) is secured by a legal charge not having priority to that charge;
and the local authority shall serve such a notice if the purpose of the advance or further advance is an approved purpose.]

(ii) conduct that consists of or involves using housing accommodation owned or managed by the landlord for an unlawful purpose, and]]
(b) that it is reasonable to make the order.
(4) When deciding whether it is reasonable to make the order, the court must consider, in particular—
(a) whether it is desirable for the dwelling-house to be managed by the landlord during the suspension period; and
(b) where the conduct mentioned in subsection (3)(a) consists of conduct by a person which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance, the effect that the conduct (or the threat of it) has had on other persons, or would have if repeated.

ceases to be effective as from the beginning of the suspension period, and (b) section 138(1) shall not apply to the landlord, in connection with such a claim,

(6) The court may, on the application of the landlord, make (on one or more occasions) a further order which extends the suspension period under the suspension order by such period as is specified in the further order.
(7) The court must not make such a further order unless it is satisfied— (a) that, since the making of the suspension order (or the last order under
subsection (6)), the tenant, or a person residing in or visiting the dwelling-house, has engaged or threatened to [F447 engage in— [F448(i) conduct that is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to some

(b) paragraph 6 of Schedule 9A applies (effect of failure to register entry protecting preserved right to buy),
in which case the right to buy ceases to be preserved.
(2) The disposal by the landlord of a qualifying dwelling-house of less than his whole interest as landlord of the dwelling-house, or in part of it, requires the consent of the [F650Secretary of State], unless the disposal is to the qualifying person or persons.

hazard concerned ceases to be a category 1 hazard, or (b) in the case of a demolition order made under section 265(3) or (4), that a
prescribed state of affairs exists, they may, in order that the person submitting the proposals may have an opportunity of carrying out the works, extend for such period as they may specify the time within which the owner of the premises is required under section 271 to demolish them.
(3) In subsection (2) “prescribed state of affairs” means such state of affairs as may be specified or described in an order made by the Secretary of State.
(4) An order under subsection (3)— (a) may make different provision for different cases or descriptions of case
(including different provision for different areas); (b) may contain such incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitory,
transitional or saving provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate; and
(c) shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
(5) That time may be further extended by the authority, once or more often as the case may require, if—
(a) the works have begun and appear to the authority to be making satisfactory progress, or
(b) though they have not begun, the authority think there has been no unreasonable delay.
(6) Where the authority determine to extend, or further extend, the time within which the owner of any premises is required under section 271 to demolish them, notice of the determination shall be served by the authority on every person having an interest in the premises or part of the premises, whether as freeholder, mortgagee or otherwise.
(7) If the works are completed to the satisfaction of the authority they shall revoke the demolition order (but without prejudice to any subsequent proceedings under this Part or Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004).]

and (b) that the other buildings (if any) in the area are dangerous or harmful to the
health or safety of the inhabitants of the area, declaring the area to be a clearance area is a course of action available to the authority in relation to the hazard or hazards for the purposes of section 5 of the Housing Act 2004 (category 1 hazards: general duty to take enforcement action).
(2ZA) The local housing authority may declare an area to be a clearance area if they are satisfied that—

CHARGES
Grant of lease 20 A charge (however created or arising) on the interest of the landlord which is not a
tenant’s incumbrance does not affect a lease granted in pursuance of the right to buy.
Conveyance of freehold 21 (1) This paragraph applies to a charge (however created or arising) on the freehold where
the freehold is conveyed in pursuance of the right to buy.
(2) If the charge is not a tenant’s incumbrance and is not a rentcharge the conveyance is effective to release the freehold from the charge; but the release does not affect the personal liability of the landlord or any other person in respect of any obligation which the charge was created to secure.
(3) If the charge is a rentcharge the conveyance shall be made subject to the charge; but if the rentcharge also affects other land—
(a) the conveyance shall contain a covenant by the landlord to indemnify the tenant and his successors in title in respect of any liability arising under the rentcharge, and
(b) if the rent charge is of a kind which may be redeemed under the M91Rentcharges Act 1977 the landlord shall immediately after the conveyance take such steps as are necessary redeem the rentcharge so far as it affects land owned by him.
(4) In this paragraph “rentcharge” has the same meaning as in the Rentcharges Act 1977; and—
(a) for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) land is owned by a person if he is the owner of it within the meaning of section 13(1) of that Act, and
(b) for the purposes of that sub-paragraph and that Act land which has been conveyed by the landlord in pursuance of the right to buy but subject to the rentcharge shall be treated as if it had not been so conveyed but had continued to be owned by him.

The estimate in the scheme of surpluses on revenue account
2 (1) References in this Schedule to the surpluses on revenue account as settled by the scheme are to the amount included in the scheme by way of an estimate under paragraph 1(4), subject to any variation of the scheme made by the local housing authority or on an appeal or application to the court.

(2) The appeal may be on any of the following grounds— (a) that, having regard to the condition of the house and to the other
circumstances, any of the works of which particulars are given in the scheme (whether already carried out or not) are unreasonable in character or extent, or are unnecessary;
(b) that any of the works do not involve expenditure which ought to be regarded as capital expenditure;
(c) that the number of individuals or households living in the house, as specified by the local housing authority in the scheme, is unreasonably low;
(d) that the estimate of the surpluses on revenue account in the scheme is unduly low on account of assumptions made by the authority as to matters within their control (for example, as to the rents charged by them).

4 (1) An account shall be kept by the local housing authority for the period during which the control order is in force showing—
(a) the surpluses on revenue account as settled by the scheme, and (b) the expenditure incurred by the authority in carrying out works of which

(2) So far as, at the end of a half-yearly period, the expenditure is not so set off, it shall carry interest, at such reasonable rate as the authority may determine, until it is so set off or until the charge arising under paragraph 16 of this Schedule (recovery of expenditure when control order ceases to have effect) is satisfied.
(3) So far as there is a sum out of the surpluses on revenue account not required to meet expenditure incurred by the authority, it shall go to meet interest under sub-paragraph (2).
