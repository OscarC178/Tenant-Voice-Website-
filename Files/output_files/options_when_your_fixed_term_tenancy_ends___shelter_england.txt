Private tenancies often start as fixed term assured shorthold tenancies. You have 3 options when your fixed term ends: sign a new agreement for a new fixed term, let your tenancy become a rolling or periodic tenancy, or leave the tenancy. Your tenancy usually ends if you leave by the last day of the fixed term. But some contracts say you have to give notice. Check your tenancy agreement.

**Joint tenancies**

It's usually easier if everyone agrees to leave or stay. A joint tenancy continues if at least one joint tenant stays after the fixed term ends. Make sure they sign a new agreement for a new tenancy. If they do not, you could be responsible for rent even if you move out.

**If your landlord contacts you**

Your landlord cannot make you sign a new agreement or make you leave without taking the 3 steps for eviction.

**Renewal agreements**

A renewal agreement is a new contract. It is usually for another fixed term. Make sure you read the whole agreement, even if your landlord says it is the same as your first one. Check important things like the rent and the length of the fixed term. Talk with the landlord if you are not happy with anything.

**After you sign the new agreement**

You and your landlord must both agree if you want to change anything or cancel the agreement. Unless there's a break clause, you cannot give notice to leave during the fixed term. Your landlord cannot evict you with a section 21 eviction notice. You cannot be charged a fee for a renewal agreement even if your agreement says you can.

**Rolling or periodic tenancies**

A periodic tenancy has no end date. Your tenancy becomes periodic if you stay after your fixed term and do not sign a new agreement.

A joint tenancy becomes periodic if any joint tenants stay on, unless there's a new agreement.

You pay your rent as usual and your agreement stays the same. Your landlord can only increase the rent if you agree or by giving you a section 13 rent increase notice. You usually end a periodic tenancy by giving your landlord 1 month's notice.

**Leaving when your fixed term ends**

Tenancies usually end if you leave by the last day of the fixed term. Some contracts become periodic tenancies unless you give notice to leave. Check your contract before the fixed term ends to see if you have to give notice and how much notice to give.

**Leaving before your fixed term ends**

You could end your fixed term tenancy early if your agreement has a break clause or your landlord agrees that you can end the tenancy early.
