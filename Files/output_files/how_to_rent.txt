This guide is for tenants and landlords in the private rented sector to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. It provides a checklist and more detailed information on each stage of the process, including what to look out for before renting, living in a rented home, what happens at the end of a tenancy, and what to do if things go wrong.

This is the most up to date version of the Guide.

We are updating the easy read which supports tenants with learning disabilities. It is supplementary to How to Rent: the checklist for renting in England and will be available as an additional supporting resource where appropriate.
