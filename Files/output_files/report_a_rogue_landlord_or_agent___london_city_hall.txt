Report a rogue landlord or agent

Please complete our form to report a rogue private landlord or letting agent. You can also use the form to report your landlord: if you think they do not have a property licence for your home, if they hold an incorrect licence, if you think they may be breaching the terms of their licence.

Your report must relate to a rental property within London. Unfortunately we cannot process complaints about rental properties outside London.

We know you may not have all the details requested in this form, but the more you can give us the easier it will be to investigate your complaint. Please put not known for any questions you don't know the answer to.

Your contact details will not be shared with the landlord or agent. You can make an anonymous report, but it will help with investigations if the enforcement authority can contact you to find out more.

Once you've completed the form, weâ€™ll send your report to the right council and ask them to investigate. If you're experiencing problems with your private landlord or letting agent, you may also wish to check our advice for renters page.
