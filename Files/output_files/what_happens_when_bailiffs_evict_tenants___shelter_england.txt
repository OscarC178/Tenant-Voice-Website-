How you know the bailiffs are coming

Bailiffs must give you 2 weeks' notice of an eviction date.

The notice of eviction is addressed to anyone named on the court order and 'any other occupiers', usually posted through your letterbox or attached to the door, in a sealed transparent envelope.

On the eviction date

Most evictions are carried out by county court bailiffs between 9am and 5pm. Some landlords use high court enforcement officers (HCEOs) to carry out the eviction. HCEOs cannot turn up before 6am or after 9pm. The notice from the bailiffs should tell you the date and time of eviction. If you're still at the property when the bailiffs come, they will ask you to leave. Ask to see their identification. They must have this with them. Bailiffs must not use violence or offensive language. You should be ready to leave and hand the keys back. They may allow you a short time to move your belongings out but it's best to do this before they come.

If you leave belongings in the property

Bailiffs do not have to give you extra time to pack your things. You may have to ask your landlord to collect any belongings you leave.

Bailiffs must not damage your belongings. County court bailiffs cannot keep your belongings to pay for court costs or for rent arrears. High court bailiffs can only keep your belongings if the court makes a separate order.

Your landlord must keep your belongings safe for a reasonable time. You might have to pay for storing or removing them. Your landlord might have to pay you damages if they throw away your belongings too soon.

If you are homeless after eviction

You might get emergency or long term housing. The council might also help you find a new home. You can ask the council for homeless help even if you are evicted from a council house or flat.
