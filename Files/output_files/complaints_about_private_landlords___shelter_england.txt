You have rights as a tenant. For example, rights to repairs, gas safety checks each year, electrical safety checks every 5 years, and to live in your home undisturbed. You can complain if your landlord does not carry out their responsibilities, treats you badly or gives you bad service.

Most councils have a private rented housing team. Contact them if you want to complain about serious problems with your landlord. This team also deals with licensing of private houses in multiple occupation (HMOs).

The council's environmental health team should come and check your home if there might be a serious problem that could put your health at risk. For example: damp and mould, structural problems, or dangerous electrical wiring.

The council must try to stop an illegal eviction if it would leave you homeless. Some councils have a tenancy relations officer or team who can step in if your landlord threatens to evict you, harasses you, or pressures you to leave.

The council can explain the law to your landlord, speak to your landlord for you about problems, and take steps to make sure your landlord follows HMO licensing rules. The council could prosecute your landlord if they keep breaking the law.

Put things in writing. Use an email or a letter to set out what your complaint is, what you want your landlord to do, and when you want your landlord to respond. Some landlords have a complaints procedure. This is usually a document which says how to make a complaint, where to send it and what steps your landlord will take to look at it.

You can complain to a letting agent if they manage your home for your landlord. If the letting agent does not get back to you or you are not happy with what they say, you can make a complaint to a letting agent redress scheme.
